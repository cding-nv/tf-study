Just Another Speech Recognizer  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03288.pdf    an ASR model comprised of 54 layers that can achieve sub 3 percent word error rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech dataset. 
Jasper (Just Another Speech Recognizer) is a deep time delay neural network (TDNN) comprising of blocks of 1D-convolutional layers. Jasper is a family of models where each model has a different number of layers. Jasper models are denoted as Jasper bxr where b and r represent:

b: the number of blocks
r: the number of repetitions of each convolutional layer within a block

We preprocess the speech signal by sampling the raw audio waveform of the signal using a sliding window of 20ms with stride 10ms. We then extract log-mel filterbank energies of size 64 from these frames as input features to the model.

We use Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train the model. The output of the model is a sequence of letters corresponding to the speech input. The vocabulary consists of all alphabets (a-z), space, and the apostrophe symbol, a total of 29 symbols including the blank symbol used by the CTC loss.
